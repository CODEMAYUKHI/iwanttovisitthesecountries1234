<h1>France</h1>
<p>If i am being honest its Paris where I actually want to go but as its a city situated in France , I am mentioning France,I mean come on isn't paris just so beautiful: </p>
 <img src="https://globalgroupts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/france_1.jpg">
<p>My wish to go to Paris was for a long time but it was never top on my bucket list until recently when I started watchin Miraculous Ladybug where i saw the animated streets and thought they were fake but came to realize later that they were real . I have always wanted to try  crossiants , macroons and cheese(I have definetly tried cheese I am talking about the cheese provided in France) and bagels obviously , bascially yes its because of the scenery and food that I really wish to go to Paris but whatever might be my motive it is true that i want to visit the "City of love" :) also I hope you to increase your cuiorisity through the videoes to go to Paris ,I mean France ~_~  </p>

    <h1>America</h1>
<img src="http://latfusa.com/media/uploads/2017/06/16/magic-for-days-video-placeholder-mobile-night-1x1-v2.jpg">
    <p>Well America is probably everyone's dream place to stay or even to well visit , I want to go to America mainly for the original 'DisneyLand' in Florida but irrespective of that its just not Florida i want to visit i would love to visit California, Los Angeles and so on....My intrest started with Disney and hollyood but as the days pass its also because I know too much about them -_- more than my culture and cities probably and my parents keep saying that too its because i watch youtube and listen to english songs and also watch english movies . Well anyways its because i know so much that not only my english is better than it used to be but visiting America is probably top on my bucket list</p>
    <p>Maybe even you can plan a trip there ;> by watching this video </p>

    <p>Honetsly I am pretty sure like me many want to visit Egypt because of its ancient history if not still its cool the point what i want to make is everyone at least once thinks of Egypt while learning its history and coming to know it has one of the 7 wonders of the world located there'THE GREAT PYRAMID OF GIZA'</p>
    <img src="https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/news/2019/01/shutterstockRF_1037036482.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&q=40&sharp=10&vib=20&ixlib=react-8.6.4">
    <img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gGh0B99BgcY/U4x3r-EpROI/AAAAAAAAeeY/vY4rNMH8AnA/s1600/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza,_Giza,_Egypt8.jpg">
    <p>I have always loved the subject history because we come to know so much about the past (the time we were not born) isn't it exciting coming to know something about previous generation the one we will never see again and most importantly learn from them as a mistake from the past must not ever be repeated again.</p>
    <p>Similarly I have heard a lot about Egypt through History and its exciting to think of seeing mummies and pyramids and tombs of the king.....Thats not it there is the longest river in the world 'Nile' in Egypt(come on dont gtell me you forgot about it ) </p>
    <img src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.MZxok3OulRA2b9Relb6QwAHaFe&pid=Api&P=0&w=259&h=191">
    <p>Well come to think of it most of the part of Egypt's history is in Britain but still Egypt is the place where the Pharaohs actually ruled over ...So in conclusion i would love to visit Egypt , hopefully this will keen your interest too:</p>
